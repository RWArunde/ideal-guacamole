with **same** 1/5th test split of students

so far we have-

100/500 iters 

skill/group	states	LFKT(const)	BKT	

----histograms
xy		2-4	both		-
css		2-4	both		-
descrip		2-4	both		-
histo		2-4	both		-
whole tutor	2-4	unconstrained	-
*wholetutor have 1000 iters 5 state LFKT constrained
(have individual skills as well)

----datashop geometry
allgeom		2 (3)	unconstrained	-
allgeom		2 (3)	constrained	-	(real longass runs on these)
circle		2-4	both		-
composition	2-4	both		-
pentagon	2-4	both		-
parallel	2-4	both		-
triangle	2-4	both		-
trapezoid	2-4	both		-
(not individual skills though...)



	
get 2-4 states first of others, both constrained & not, then go ahead with 5
whole_tutor
(geom stuff?)

*then get skill_usefuleness model, need *lots* of iterations here
xy,
descrip,
css,
whole
